  <p>Nowadays learning about computer science is one of the most important knowledge in our lives regardless of the university career we have to choose because the tegnology every day has innovated with great growth and learning about computer science helps us a lot in our future to be prepared ...<br>  
    <br>
    Nowadays I can say that I never expect to know so much about computer science or have knowledge of some language of programming and everything I have learned is thanks to ¡Superate! because before I started in ¡Supérate! I had no knowledge of computer science, the only knowledge I had of a computer were; turn on a laptop, look for information on the internet and then turn off the computer, I did not know how to use any of the office tools, the only one of which I had more knowledge was word but I did not know all the interesting options that could be made from that application. All this because before entering ¡Superate! I did not have a computer in my house to which I could use.  <br>
    <br>
    During these three years in ¡Superate! I have learned a lot, now I can say that word, power point, and excel were used well that was one of the most difficult challenges that I achieved, I had no idea of all the operations that can be done from excel and that using it we save a lot of time to take accounts or perform another type of activity that is related to accounts and numbers, today I can say that I have learned to use Microsoft tools. Learning how to make a logo and see how creative one can do in the design part was something incredible, something new for me which today I have that great knowledge. And the best thing I've been able to learn and I think it was something I never imagined having knowledge of was with respect to programming, during these years in overcoming! In computer science I have learned how to design a web page, how to develop a program, I have learned how to use html and what it is specified, how and for what to use JavaScript, how to work with angular and other tools in programming. <br>
    <br>
    In conclusion it should be emphasized if it had not been for the classes received in ¡Superate! on computer science today I would not have any programming knowledge and I would not have realized how interesting computer science is and all the good that can be done with it. It is thanks to the computer science classes in Get over it! that today I have obtained that learning about programming and excel, and that it has helped me to know how to handle a computer in the fastest way.
